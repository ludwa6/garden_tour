# Botanic Garden Self-Guided Tour App

A Progressive Web App (PWA) for creating self-guided botanical garden tours with iNaturalist integration.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a consumer-facing app that enables self-guided tours through a botanic garden, facilitating closer connections to nature while using mobile devices as tools to inform and enrich that connection rather than as the primary focus.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Location Triggers**: GPS-based auto-triggers when available, QR code fallbacks for reliability
- **iNaturalist Integration**: Direct connection to botanical observation database
- **Optional Gamification**: Badges, challenges, and scavenger hunts for enhanced engagement
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet connection using cached content
- **Progressive Web App**: Cross-platform compatibility without app store requirements

## Documentation

- [Chat Transcript & Requirements](docs/chat-transcript.md) - Original conversation outlining project requirements and architecture
- [Project Architecture](docs/) - Technical implementation details (coming soon)
- [Workflow Diagrams](docs/) - Visual process flows (coming soon)

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Progressive Web App (PWA) with vanilla JavaScript
- **Maps**: Leaflet.js or custom SVG garden maps
- **Data**: Static JSON/GeoJSON for POI information
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages or similar static hosting
- **External APIs**: iNaturalist API for species data and observations

## Getting Started

This project is currently in the planning and design phase. See the chat transcript for detailed architectural discussions and next steps.
